    <h2>Our Research Focus</h2>
    <p>
      Translating the thinking of systems biology to the field of autism genetics with the intent to develop effective early-stage diagnostics and targets for therapeutic intervention. The work involves the generation and analysis of genomic and phenotypic databases using computational tools of systems biology, machine learning and network inference.

    <h2>Clinical Research</h2>
    <p>
      Efforts to understand and characterize the clinical significance and utility of human genetic variation. This work involves clinical-grade annotation of human genetic variation, estimating the rates of both true and false positives in present day genetic testing and their likely impacts on the practice of personalized care, the construction of an authoritative knowledgebase for clinical decision support, and efforts in educating present and future doctors on the potentials of genomics in individualized healthcare.

    <h2>Computational Disease Analyses</h2>
    <p>
      Redefining human diseases through computational and comparative network analysis. The work involves the integration and analysis of transcriptomic, genomic and bibliomic data to network all known human diseases. Deliverables include revealing disease connections, properly reshaping blurred boundaries of classification, and opportunities for drug treatment repositioning.

    <h2>Current Projects</h2>
    <p>
      Our lab is interested in the design and application of translational bioinformatics tools to help bring whole-genomic data to the point of clinical care. Our research projects are designed to complement and potentially supplant standard molecular diagnostics currently being used to characterize a patient’s autoimmune deficiencies and/or complex behavioral disorders, with the intent to have a faster and more robust system in place for real-time genomic diagnostics. <a class="yellow" href="{{ site.url }}/research">(Find out more)</a>

Our lab is interested in the design and application of translational bioinformatics tools to help bring whole-genomic data to the point of clinical care. Our current area of focus is autism. Additional areas of interest include breast cancer, melanoma, lung and prostate cancer. We are developing new techniques for the analysis of whole-genomic data, including fully sequenced tumor genomes and companion whole-genomic transcriptional assays, so that these data can be rapidly transformed into clinically actionable reports that yield prognostic predictions, drive decision support for alternative lines of therapy, and other medically actionable outcomes. 

As part of this work, we are currently building a database of somatic and germline variants of known or probable clinical impact. This line of research is designed to complement and potentially supplant standard molecular diagnostics currently being used to characterize patients, with the intent to have a faster and more robust system in place for real-time genomic diagnostics. Also as part of this effort, I co-direct and co-teach courses in the analysis and clinical interpretation of next-generation sequence data and whole-genome analysis. 

My lab is also comparing what is known about the genetics of autism with the genetic systems of other behaviorally related neurological disorders. One basic hope is that we will find “usual suspects” that have significant implications for neurological malfunction. A grander hope is that the work will result in a clearer genotype-phenotype map for autism, i.e. that it will enable us to circumscribe sections of the genetic landscape of autism that cause epilepsy, seizure disorder, schizophrenia, etc., thereby leading to a set of genetic markers that can be used for diagnosis/prognosis. 

We are also hoping to level the playing field to enable all autism researchers to tap into the benefits of computational systems biology for deciphering the genetic map of autism – by making our informatics approaches and results accessible through various web applications.
