## Overview
This is a gene-disorder-publication database that gathers and ranks associations between genes and disorders, based on evidences from all publication abstracts available via PubMed.

### Specific Aims
We’ve developed an application that includes a comprehensive list of genes associated with disorders and the evidence supporting that association all in one place. For each targeted disorder, we collect all abstracts related to the disorder, then filter out abstracts with specific genetic test results. Collected test result are ranked based on the number of supporting evidences, publication journals, and the time of publication.
