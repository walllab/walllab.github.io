# Roundup
<hr>

## Overview
Roundup is a large-scale orthology database. The orthologs are computed using the Reciprocal Smallest Distance (RSD) algorithm. This algorithm detects more (and more accurate) orthologs than reciprocal best blast hits and gives each ortholog a score based on its maximum likelihood evolutionary distance. Every release of Roundup downloads the latest genomes from UniProt and computes orthologs for them.
