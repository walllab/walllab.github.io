# Guess What?
<hr>

## Overview
This educational charades game is a research study for parents of children between the ages of 3 and 12 years. Families who participate are helping researchers in the Wall Lab use machine learning and artificial intelligence to analyze behaviors expressed by children while interacting with family members via home video.

Choose between six different decks and play this exciting charades game on your phone with your kids, and optionally, help contribute to research on developmental delay by sharing your videos with the research team.
