# Machine Learning Diagnostic Classifiers
<hr>

## Overview
We developed eight classifiers using decision tree learning that performed optimally for classification of a wide range of individuals both on and off the autism spectrum. These classifiers are substantially shorter than the gold standard diagnostic instruments in the field today and both classifiers pinpoint several behavioral patterns that could guide future methods for expeditious observation-based screening and diagnosis in and out of clinical settings.

### Specific Aims
- To apply machine learning to medical records generated through the administration of standard diagnostic test procedures to find minimal sets of features that can be used in models to achieve highly accurate outcomes
- To find and build efficient (mobile) ways to capture data needed by these models
- To scale these approaches to reach a greater percentage of the population in need than what is possible today

*Using archival data, we used feature selection and classification techniques to choose a subset of features on the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) from which we can distinguish ASD and ADHD. In work in submission, this method has been validated on data gathered through a mobile survey system.*
