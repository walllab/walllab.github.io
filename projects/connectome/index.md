# Connectome 
<hr>

## Overview
A social network analysis of autism-focused research trends across the country starting in the year 2000. This tool enables the visualization of research connections between authors, institutions and across disciplines in a given year, as well as the change in these connections over time.  

### Specific Aims
We aim to compile all research related to autism from 2000 to present in order to quantify the growth of the field as a whole, as well as to identify major research hubs throughout the country. We will also study the trends in collaborative research over time, including the change in the nature of the collaborations as interdisciplinary or not.
