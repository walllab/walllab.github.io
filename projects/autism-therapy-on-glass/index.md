# Autism Therapy on Glass
<hr>

## Overview
The Autism Glass Project is an interdisciplinary effort bringing together some of the brightest minds in psychiatry, behavioral science, human-computer interaction and artificial intelligence to create an assistive tool for facial emotion recognition. Based out of the Wall Lab in the Systems Medicine division of the Stanford School of Medicine Pediatrics department, the Autism Glass Project seeks to provide individuals with challenges navigating social cues with a clinically validated therapeutic device to aid in interpreting facial expressions.
