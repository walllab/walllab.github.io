# Home Video Project
<hr>

## Overview
Early childhood videos of children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder provide important insights into the behavioral manifestations of ASD compared to typically developing children. Although not done routinely, application of standard diagnostic instruments to home videos enables rapid detection of the core features of autism.

### Specific Aims
To evaluate the feasibility of applying the Video-Based Classifier by non-clinicians for accurate detection of autism spectrum disorders in short home videos from YouTube.
