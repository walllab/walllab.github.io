	<h2>Gamified Data Collection & Digital Intervention</h2>
    <p>
    The Wall Lab at Stanford is committed to developing AI-enhanced and data backed games that can improve early detection and intervention options for complex conditions that originate in childhood and perpetuate through the life course, including autism and related developmental delays.

	<h2>AI Model Development</h2>
    <p>
	We're on a mission to pioneer early detection and enhance outcomes for children with ASD and related developmental delays. Rooted in our mission we explore all frontiers spanning from detection to improving algorithmic performance and building robust datasets. By embracing these diverse fronts, we're committed to uncovering insights that can make a tangible difference.

	<h3>Overview on current research:</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<h4>Ensemble Learning</h4>
			<p>
			Ensemble learning offers a versatile framework for leveraging the strengths of multiple models. Using ensemble learning approaches we can identify subgroups within the spectrum by clustering individuals based on their characteristics or response patterns, thereby enabling more personalized interventions or treatments.
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<h4>Crowdsourcing for NT data</h4>
			<p>
			Limited data set size can compromise the generalizability and robustness of the AI models, particularly in health-critical fields like digital phenotyping that require minimal bias and optimal performance. Crowdsourcing enables one to tap into the collective wisdom and capabilities of a diverse group of individuals, fostering collaboration, and problem-solving on a global scale. It offers a flexible and scalable approach to addressing various challenges.
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<h4>Temporal Adaptation</h4>
			<p>
			We introduce Temporal consistency for Test-time adaptation (TempT), a novel method for test-time adaptation on videos through the use of temporal coherence of predictions across sequential frames as a self-supervision signal. TempT is an approach with broad potential applications in computer vision tasks, including facial expression recognition (FER) in videos.

    <p>
    This game is a research study for parents of children between the ages of 3 and 12 years. Families who participate in this game are helping researchers in the Wall Lab use machine learning and artificial intelligence to analyze behaviors expressed by children while interacting with family members via home video.

    This study aims to improve our understanding of the link between gut microbiome functionality, genome variation, and ASD phenotype, and reveal the specific mechanisms by which the gut microbiome interacts with autism-related alleles to produce and modify ASD. We use the 16s sequence-based biomarkers to better capture phylogenetic relationships between microbiome taxa.

    <p>
    The Wall Lab, the Winograd Lab, and Sension are building a new tool on Google Glass, an interdisciplinary effort bringing together some of the brightest minds in psychiatry, behavioral science, human-computer interaction and artificial intelligence to create an assistive tool for facial emotion recognition. The Autism Glass Project seeks to provide individuals with challenges navigating social cues with a clinically validated therapeutic device to aid in interpreting facial expressions.

    Through a collaborative effort that includes researchers from Stanford, UCLA, the New York Genome Center, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, and the Simons Foundation, we have amassed a collection of whole genomes and phenotypic measurements on thousands of individuals from families with autism. This platform will help researchers explore connections across data and individuals to more precisely understand autism.
