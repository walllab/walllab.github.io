# SysMed
<hr>

## Overview
We’ve developed a web application that provides you with the tools to visualize autism’s genetics. It contains a network of the genes linked to autism, and helps you to visualize the ways in which they interact. SysMed also provides methods for examining genes shared with other disorders.

### Specific Aims
We seek to provide an easy-to-use resource that combines gene interaction and gene-disease association data on autism to enable network construction, visualization and comparison with other related neurological disorders. We hope to apply network thinking and cross-disease analysis to offer a dynamic picture of how autism genes interact within and between disorders and help to understand the complex genetic landscape of ASD.
