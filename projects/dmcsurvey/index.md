## Overview
Our first, successful clinical application of the tools developed from the Machine Learning Project. We recruited patients at the Developmental Medicine Center, Boston Children’s Hospital who were scheduled for a team consultation with behavioral diagnosticians. We collected responses to the Caregiver-Directed Classifier and home videos.

### Specific Aims
To prospectively assess the sensitivity and specificity of the machine learning algorithms in an intended use sample of children referred to a developmental team consultation clinic for developmental/behavioral concerns. We also wanted to assess the feasibility of obtaining home video footage for children referred to a developmental consultation clinic for developmental/behavioral concerns.
