# “Route 66” to Autism: Identifying a common molecular signature in ASD gene expression
<hr>

## Overview
Integration of all gene expression experiments conducted on different types of tissue from autism cases and matched controls to determine if a unique ASD signature exists. We also aim to test whether regulatory patterns in the brain relevant to autism can also be detected in peripheral blood.

### Specific Aims
Our goal is to conduct an integrated systems biology analysis of all published autism gene expression to verify whether a detectable signal in the blood of autistic individuals mirrors what might be an important signal of dysregulation in brain. We will also pursue further analysis to support the role of possible candidate genes including regulation within normal tissue and experimental validation in mouse models.
