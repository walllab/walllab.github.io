# GapMap
<hr>

## Overview
As the number of autism diagnoses has increased, we have no true handle on the size and severity of gaps in access to autism-related resources and exactly where the widest divides exist in the US or globally. To combat these issues of (1) mapping the true prevalence of autism and (2) quantifying gaps in access to key intervention services, we built [GapMap](https://gapmap.stanford.edu/): a crowd-based mobile platform to track the prevalence of autism in real-time and find autism-related resources that can be accessed from any mobile device or computer.

[GapMap](https://gapmap.stanford.edu/) engages the massive and growing community of families with autism to capture geographic, diagnostic, and resource usage information while automatically computing prevalence at granular geographical scales to yield a more complete and dynamically updated understanding of autism resource epidemiology.
