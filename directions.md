#Directions to the Wall Lab

The Wall Lab is on the first floor of Medical School Office Building (MSOB), on the corner of Campus Drive West and Welch Road, between Panama Street and Welch Road.  Entering the building from the parking lot side, you will turn left and walk past the elevators and down the hall to the door at the end. Once inside the suite, turn right.  At the end of the short hall you will turn left at the corner Cubicle. Follow this corridor down all the way to the last office on the right hand side, X141.  This is Dr. Wall’s office.

A second option for parking is in the large parking lot across the street on Welch Road.  Entrance to the lot is from Stock Farm Road or Oak Road, but you have to drive within the lot towards the corner of Welch Road and Campus Drive.  There are many spots available here, and payment is through cash, coins, or credit card using an automated permit dispenser.
