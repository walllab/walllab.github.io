        <h4>Associate Professor</h4>
        <p>
          Maude joined the lab in January 2014 and namely studies the gut microbiome of children with ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder) utilizing a large scale, crowd sourced clinical study approach. Her expertise are in microbiology, bioinformatics and genomics, using and integrating metagenomics, metatranscriptomics and metaproteomics to understand microbial community functions.
		  She received her PhD in February 2010 from the Ecole Centrale de Lyon, University of Lyon, France, with Prof. T.M. Vogel, on the origin of the dehalogenases and bioremediation of chlorinated solvent.  Her grad-school work focused on the bacterial adaptation to chlorinated compounds at the genome (evolution mechanisms) and community (bioremediation) level. After graduation, she became a post-doctoral fellow at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory with Prof. Janet Jansson. Her work looked at the impact of climate change on soil microbial ecology and specifically at how altered precipitation affect carbon cycle using meta-“omics” analysis of microbial carbon cycling responses.

        <h4>Research Scholar</h4>
        <p>
          Leticia is conducting an integrated systems biology analysis of all published autism spectrum disorders gene expression to test whether a common signature exists between blood and brain. She also performs cross-disease analysis of autism and other related disorders, as this approach may unravel the evidence of molecular overlap among these conditions and suggest common molecular mechanisms that could provide relevant insights into the etiology and pathology of autism.
		  In her spare time, Leticia enjoys hanging out with friends in the search for great “tapas”, watching old movies, going to the beach, hiking and travelling.

Watson Research Center since 2006, from which he is currently on a leave-of-absence. In IBM Research, he led the research effort to develop AI technologies for Internet of Things (IoT) systems and applications and also worked on various research projects related to distributed systems, micro cloud, edge computing, and network analytics and management. He was an IBM Master Inventor (2013-2019), holding 40+ US patents, and served in invention development advisory/review board in IBM. Prior to joining IBM Research, he worked as a Senior Member of Research Staff in Philips Research North America, and as a research engineer in LG Electronics, Korea. In 1999, he co-founded a start-up, NeoMTel, Inc., in which he developed a new mobile animation codec that was shipped in more than 100 million mobile phones worldwide at the time. He received his Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from Columbia University in 2006, and B.S. and M.S. degrees from Seoul National University in South Korea.

Before, Voss worked in mobile software engineering with the startup PayNearMe.
		  Voss grew up and graduated from Leonardo Da Vinci Gymnasium high school near Heidelberg, Germany. He was interested in technology from a young age. When he was twelve, he taught himself the basics of mobile software development when iPhone apps first became popular. A year later, he started a German podcast about iOS development. Voss's tutorials quickly gained > 200,000 views and became the #1 podcast on the German iTunes store. In 2009, he began working with a startup in Stuttgart on iPhone apps for the U.S. Army stationed in Europe and launched five applications before he turned 15. Steve Capps hired Voss as a software engineer in 2010 to work on his Silicon Valley startup PayNearMe’s mobile product. Voss worked on the company’s iPhone, Android, and web platforms and helped launch a mobile cash payments platform.
		  In 2012, Voss joined Stanford University at age 17 to pursue a degree in Computer Science (advisee of Professors Terry Winograd and Jerry Cain). During the same year, Voss advised the executive team of Germany's largest media company Axel Springer on structuring a technology partnership between a Silicon Valley outpost and Germany. His role gained national attention when the German magazine DER SPIEGEL covered his work in 2013. Today, As an IIR in the StartX program, Voss advises StartX’s founders on mobile engineering.
