Nate joined the Wall Lab in September 2016 working on both the iHART and Autism Glass projects. Graduating with a B.S. in Mathematical and Computational Science in 2012 and a M.S. in Aero/Astro Engineering from Stanford in 2015, Nate is continuing his work on the genetic causes and quantification of psychiatric diseases through the Stanford Neuroscience Ph.D program. 

Excited to apply his mathematical and software engineering background to challenges in genomics and objective measures of psychiatric diseases, Nate looks forward to completing his Ph.D in the Wall Lab.
