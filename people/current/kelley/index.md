Kelley joined the lab in August 2016. Her background is in computational math and software development for bioinformatics. She has a BS in Mathematics from MIT and received her MS in Computational Math and Engineering from Stanford in 2016.

The focus of her research is to develop theoretically rigorous statistical methods and algorithms that leverage existing biological knowledge and that can be scaled to massive datasets. She is currently working on the iHART project with the goal of defining the subtypes of autism using large-scale information on both phenotype and genotype.
