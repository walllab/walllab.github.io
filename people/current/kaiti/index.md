Kaiti joined the lab in May 2018 from North Carolina after working as a research specialist at UNC-Chapel Hill.  Prior to her work at UNC, she completed a Masters in research psychology at University of Bath, and undergraduate degree in psychology at Duke University. Kaiti has over 4 years’ experience working in a variety of research settings, and over 5 years’ experience working directly with children and adults with autism as a direct support professional.
