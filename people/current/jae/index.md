Jae-Yoon Jung joined the lab in 2009. His current work involves developing new methodologies for finding plausible gene-disease associations among mental disorders. He is also involved in developing next generation sequencing pipelines running on clouds.

He received his doctoral degree in computer science from University of Maryland, College Park. After graduation, he joined the Biomedical Research Lab (School of Computing) and the Laboratory of Integrative Motor Behavior (The Centre for Neuroscience Studies) at Queen's University, where he did his postdoctoral training in analyzing stroke (CVA) data. He is interested in applying computational approaches to the challenging problems in biomedical informatics.
