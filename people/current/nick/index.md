### Computer Vision for Autism Therapy
Nick joined the lab in August 2014 and is working on a project to put social cue recognition and gaze tracking technology on Google Glass for the purpose of psychology research and autism therapy. Currently, his efforts are directed at applying machine learning and computer vision techniques to recognize emotions, so that the device can provide feedback to its users in a way that helps them learn these cues on their own. 

### Machine Learning and Computer Vision
Nick is interested in machine learning, computer vision, and human-computer interaction. His work thus far has primarily involved face detection and tracking, using Constrained Local Models. On top of this, he developed engagement scoring, gaze tracking, and emotion detection for the purpose of testing and producing engaging content in online courseware.

### Mathematics
Nick graduated from Stanford in August 2013 with a PhD in Mathematics, studying partial differential equations and mathematical physics, specifically in the field of microlocal analysis with a focus on applications to scattering theory. He remains interested in this and the broad aim of a rigorous mathematical understanding of the foundations of quantum field theory.
