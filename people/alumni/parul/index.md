Miss Kudtarkar was member of the Wall Lab from January 2009-December 2010. During her tenure at Wall lab she ported computation of Roundup (a comparative genomics algorithm) to Amazon's cloud computing environment and expanded the database to include all sequenced genomes. The pipeline of porting comparative genomics tools to cloud infrastructure was published in the manuscripts titled Cloud computing for comparative genomics and Cost-effective cloud computing. She also investigated the relationship between various divergence parameters for ortholog detection among species. Currently she is a Scientific Programmer at Caltechâ€™s Biology department (Center for Computational Regulatory Genomics/E.H. Davidson Lab) and is responsible for building an Echinoderm database and genome analysis tools.
