Jack spent two summers in the lab as an intern in 2010 and 2011.  In 2012, he graduated from the University of Northern Iowa with a BS in Bioinformatics and a BA in Biology and began his PhD in the Bioinformatics and Integrative Genomics program at Harvard co-mentored by Dennis Wall and Mark Daly.

Currently, he is involved in a number of research projects ranging from improving power in meta-analyses of single variants in exome sequencing data using case/control and trio data to using machine learning techniques to improve autism diagnostic tests.

In his spare time, Jack enjoys swimming, going to the symphony, and dabbling in the stock market.
