Marlena joined the Wall Lab in January 2011 as a co-op student from Northeastern University, and began full time work as a clinical research associate after graduating with a Bachelorâ€™s in Biology in 2013.  Currently, her research is geared towards developing novel methods for shortening the behavioral diagnosis of autism and analysis of their efficacy both clinically and computationally.  She is also working on applying innovative social media approaches to enhance our understanding of autism and genetic disease as a whole.

In her off hours, she enjoys taking advantage of the California sunshine on a local hike, at the beach or going on a run with her Australian shepherd rescue puppy, Lilah.
