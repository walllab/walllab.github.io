Nikhila is a computer science major at Princeton University. She joined the Wall Lab in the summer of 2013, and has since been spearheading GAPMap, a web tool that hopes to enable global autism epidemiology and connect families to fundamental services through the power of crowd-sourcing.

In her free time, Nikhila enjoys watching photorealistically animated films, playing piano, and eating/cooking spicy South Indian food. She's been told that she has a 'creative and out-of-the-box approach to life,' and she completely agrees.
