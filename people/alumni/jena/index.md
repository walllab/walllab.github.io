Jena joined the Wall Lab in 2012 after graduating from Boston University. Jena manages the lab’s clinical trials, acts as the liaison for collaborations, research participants, investigators, study teams, and healthcare professionals. She also works with the IRB and oversees the preparation, submission, recruitment processes, modification and renewal for these protocols. She ensures the safety of clinical research subjects, compliance, adherence to approved protocols, and coordinates clinical treatment, study visits, and follow-up care as it pertains to the trials.

Outside of work, you will find her at the beach, hiking, horseback riding, playing soccer, snowboarding, or practicing yoga. She is also a proud owner of one of the lab’s mascots, Emma (blue merle border collie).
