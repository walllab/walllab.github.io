Stephen worked on the database design, application logic, and UI design on the Autism Microbiome Research Portal. He worked on engineering the data and visualization architecture for the Autism Connectome. He worked on systems administration for GAPMap. He also reduced content redundancy, optimized pages, and implemented and designed UI features to the Wall Lab homepage.

In his spare time, Stephen can usually be found in a bicycle lane or at some event in the area if he isn't playing with some new API, language or library he found.
