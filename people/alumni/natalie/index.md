Natalie joined the lab in the summer of 2019 following her first year as a pre-medical student at Columbia University, where she was selected as a John Jay Scholar. Recently, she worked on emotion and video annotations to create a video feature matrix of digital ASD phenotypes for the construction of machine learning classifiers in various projects.

In college, Natalie is a campus tour guide, officer of Blockchain at Columbia, and member of the Columbia Taekwondo team. When she isnâ€™t busy, she likes to make alt rock playlists, watch stand-up comedy, and explore New York City.
