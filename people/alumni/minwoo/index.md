Min Woo joined the lab in June 2017 as an undergraduate senior double majoring in statistics and economics at UCLA. Currently, he is continuing his work on the iHART autism genomics project. His focus is to apply coalitional game theory and various clustering methods to find the genetic associations for ASD.

Min Woo is interested in developing statistical learning methods that will help make challenges in bioinformatics more tractable. Outside of work, he enjoys sailing, hiking, and playing guitar.
