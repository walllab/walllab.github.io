Guhan, an undergraduate senior majoring in Bioengineering and minoring in Computer Science, joined the Wall Lab in January 2016. He has since worked on the iHART autism genomics project and has done network burden analyses downstream of the main study. He hopes to be a graduate student in Biomedical Informatics.

Guhan enjoys eating copious amounts of food, sleeping for copious amounts of time, and copious amounts of Netflix binge-watching. He also enjoys playing his instrument, the veena, and performs widely throughout the country. He is the President of the Indian classical music club, Spicmacay Stanford.

He used to enjoy running before college took away his work ethic.
