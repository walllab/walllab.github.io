Preston recently completed his undergraduate education in Bioengineering at Stanford and is pursuing his Master's degree in Computer Science. He is currently working on several exciting projects in the Wall lab, from using machine learning approaches to study autism phenotypic data in hopes of developing advanced diagnostic tools to developing cloud genomic pipelines. 

When he is not busy hacking away on his computer, Preston can be found performing opera and musical theatre on stage. Last year, Preston had the invaluable opportunity to play The Baker in Into the Woods, the title role of Candide and Mark in RENT at Stanford.
