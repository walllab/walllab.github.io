Titas De is a Computer Vision Engineer at The Wall Lab at Stanford who is working to successfully bring the Autism Glass Project to market use under the supervision of Dr. Terry Winograd and Dr. Dennis Wall. He has over 4 years of experience in computer vision and machine learning working on diverse set of applications. Prior to joining Stanford, Titas has worked at a medical device company focusing on using computer vision algorithms for effective blood management during surgeries and has 1 provisional patent under his name. He has always been interested in applying state-of-the-art technology to solve healthcare problems right from his undergrad days in India. He has a great deal of experience in the field of medical imaging working on different projects as part of his masters. While pursuing his research at University of Rochester under Dr. Axel Wismueller, Titas developed novel algorithms to correctly estimate the bio-mechanical strength of the proximal femur bone which eliminates the need for a traditional and costly mechanical analysis. He has already published a several papers related to that research.
