Albee is a first-year graduate student in the Biomedical Informatics PhD program at Stanford. She graduated from Johns Hopkins University in 2013 and stayed as a research assistant the following year. As her senior thesis, she examined the effects of genetic drift in the Mennonite population, a genetic isolate. She has also analyzed exome sequencing and DNA microarray data to uncover genes enriched in rare deleterious variants in patients with Hirschsprung’s Disease (a multifactorial disorder with non-Mendelian inheritance patterns). She is very excited to join the Wall Lab for her first rotation as well as become part of the collaborative effort to study Autism. Specifically, she will be looking into relationships between the output of Autism behavioral classifiers and patients’ genetic profiles.
