Prathamesh joined the Wall Lab as a Machine Learning intern in May 2020. He worked on building a robust emotion classifier to be embedded into mobile tools such SuperPowerGlass or as a new game in the GuessWhat application to help children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) navigate human emotions. His primary objective was to improve the performance of the baseline ResNet-50.h5 emotion classifier using facial expressions extracted from TikTok's face challenge videos by constructing a data pipeline and further applying computer vision and transfer learning techniques.
