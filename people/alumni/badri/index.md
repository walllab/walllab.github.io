My research is focused on studying next-generation sequencing techniques in families to find genetic underpinnings of neurological disorders. I am particularly interested in developing novel analytical and bioinformatics tools for rare-variant, gene-gene and gene-environment interaction analyses. Currently, I am studying exome and genome level data from multiplex Caribbean Hispanic families to determine rare causal variants that confer risk of Alzheimerâ€™s Disease (AD). I am also a member of statistical analysis groups for international and nation-wide consortia for Alzheimer disease studying genome-wide association, whole exome and whole genome sequencing data.
