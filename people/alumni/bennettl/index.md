Bennett Liu is a junior at Stanford studying symbolic systems with a neuroscience concentration. In his free time, he loves to surf, spend time outdoors, and discuss theories of consciousness and how the brain came to be. He is passionate about developing a better understanding of the brain and scaling neurotechnology (BCIs, digital therapeutics, telemedicine) in under-resourced settings. He believes these interventions can have great reach and impact on very large populations, and would love to spend his life delivering these aids to those who need it most.
