Bongjun Ko is an AI Engineering Fellow at the Stanford Institute for Human-centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI) working to develop and apply artificial intelligence technologies for high-stake situations involving humans. In the Wall Lab, he is currently participating in a project developing machine-learning methods for helping children with autism through computer vision. Before joining Stanford HAI in September 2019, he worked as a Research Staff Member and Research Manager at the IBM T. J. Watson Research Center since 2006, from which he is currently on a leave-of-absence. In IBM Research, he led the research effort to develop AI technologies for Internet of Things (IoT) systems and applications and also worked on various research projects related to distributed systems, micro cloud, edge computing, and network analytics and management. He was an IBM Master Inventor (2013-2019), holding 40+ US patents, and served in invention development advisory/review board in IBM. Prior to joining IBM Research, he worked as a Senior Member of Research Staff in Philips Research North America, and as a research engineer in LG Electronics, Korea. In 1999, he co-founded a start-up, NeoMTel, Inc., in which he developed a new mobile animation codec that was shipped in more than 100 million mobile phones worldwide at the time. He received his Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from Columbia University in 2006, and B.S. and M.S. degrees from Seoul National University in South Korea.
