Anish Nag joined the efforts of the Wall Lab in June 2016 on GapMap and shifted focus onto the Autism Glass Project in January of 2017. As a senior at Monta Vista High School in Cupertino, He works extensively with large amounts of vision data and probabilistic models to search for discriminating features between neurotypical children and children with neurodevelopmental disorders.

If you canâ€™t find him at the intersection of computer science, statistics, and medicine, he is either reading, traveling, or on an adventure.
