Michael's main responsibility in the lab is to not break the internet, so if you're reading this, then he's doing his job.

In a former life, he was an explorer in Southern China for five years where he satiated his voracious appetite for knowledge, food, and culture.

He also finds it weird to write about himself in the third person.
