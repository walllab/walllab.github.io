Soren Sutaria is a rising senior at the Menlo School (class of 2022). He is an avid tennis player and co-directs the Mountain View program of ACEing Autism. This program brings structured tennis to local children on the Autism spectrum. 

At his school, Soren led the first-ever TEDxMenloSchool initiative. He is also captain of his high school tennis team, which ranks top 20 in the nation by UTR. 
Hoping to combine his interests in science and problem-solving with the passion to help children with Autism, Soren joined the Wall Lab team. He will now begin working on Gapmap in hopes of creating easier access to Autism services around the country.
