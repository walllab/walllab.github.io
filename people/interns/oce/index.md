Oce joined the Wall Lab in the fall of 2018, in the beginning of her junior year at Dougherty Valley High School. She worked on analyzing videos for a range of studies involving machine learning. Currently, she’s working on quantifying the results from the Autism Glass project and helping compile a list of early behavioral markers of autism for the Guess What study. When she’s not in the lab, Oce can be found canvassing the bike trails near her home, volunteering as a peer support for special needs children, or writing for her school newspaper.
