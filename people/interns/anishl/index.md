Anish joined the Wall Lab in June 2021 as a rising sophomore at Lynbrook High School. His research is focused on creating computer vision classifiers to detect behaviors indicative of Autism Spectrum Disorder in videos. This summer he worked on trying to use an LSTM network to detect hand flapping in the Self-Stimulatory Behavior Dataset. Anish hopes that his work will be useful in accelerating the pace of autism diagnosis. Outside of the lab, Anish loves to learn new programming languages and read. His favorite book is The Alchemist.
