Cathy joined the Wall Lab in June 2019 through the Stanford Institutes of Medicine Summer Research program (SIMR) as a rising senior at Henry M. Gunn High School. She worked on creating new features for Guess What? and is developing a facial emotion classifier designed specifically for pediatric populations to enhance the gameâ€™s therapeutic ability. Outside of the lab, Cathy loves dancing, robotics, and binge-watching TV shows.
