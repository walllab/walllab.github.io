Nathan joined the Wall Lab in June 2021 and is a rising high school senior. His research addresses automatically detecting autism in Guess What? audio clips. To accomplish this goal, heâ€™s worked with a variety of approaches, including using traditional statistical classifiers with MFCC coefficients as input, as well as training CNNs and Wav2Vec2 models. Outside the lab, he enjoys playing music and eurogames.
