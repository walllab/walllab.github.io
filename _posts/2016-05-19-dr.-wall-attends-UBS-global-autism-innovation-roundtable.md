title: Dr. Wall attends UBS Global Autism Innovation Roundtable
---
In late April, Dr. Wall attended UBS's Global Autism Innovation Roundtable in San Francisco. An article on the event by [USA Today](http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2016/04/27/autism-advocates-look-tech-but-cash-issue/83545750/) touches on the advocacy for autism research, especially where it is powered by technology. UBS put some of the top scientists and researchers at the same table as 50 potential philanthropic, private funders to discuss advances and the need for money to support labs' continued efforts in a field that continues to grow and evolve. As evidence is gathered of technology playing a more central role in treatment and social coping options for children and adults with autism, the need has significantly increased for sufficient funding to move technology-based research. The Global Autism Innovation Roundtable was an opportunity for potential funders to support unique and innovative research of autism.
