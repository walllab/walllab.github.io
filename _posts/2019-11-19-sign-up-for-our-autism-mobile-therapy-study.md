title: Will you use Digital Health to Contribute to Autism Research?
---
In the last decade, autism spectrum disorder (ASD) prevalence in the U.S. increased by over 200%, affecting 1 in 40 children.<sup>1,2</sup> Autism is estimated to affect 2% of children worldwide,<sup>2,3</sup> and has become one of the most pressing pediatric health concerns globally.<sup>4,5,6,7</sup> Standard approaches to diagnosis, such as the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS)<sup>8</sup> and the Autism Diagnostic Interview (ADI-R),<sup>9,10</sup> and to therapy, such as Applied Behavioral Analysis (ABA), are difficult to access due to shortages of clinical practitioners, particularly in lower-income countries.<sup>9,11,12</sup> The average age of diagnosis in the U.S. is 5 years of age for high-income and 8 years of age for low-income families. <sup>2,13,14</sup> Roughly 27% of U.S. children over the age of 8 remain undiagnosed.<sup>15</sup>

There is a high urgency to resolve these widespread problems with access to care. Research has shown that behavioral therapy by 5 years of age 17-21 can lessen or even eliminate core autism deficits including restricted and/or repetitive behaviors, difficulty with language, poor social attention, inability to understand facial expressions, and disinterest with social interactions.<sup>17,19,22-28</sup> Worse, the impact of the interventions degrades after the age of 5, and by 8 years of age, children often do not respond as effectively. Therefore, early detection and therapy are both of vital importance.

Arguably, the most potent way to address this health crisis is via digital technologies. Children with ASD have shown high engagement with gamified systems which present an exciting opportunity for the development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic platform.<sup>29</sup> As one example, researchers at King’s College London recently developed an interactive game, ECHOES, which allowed children to acquire social communication and emotional regulation skills through guided interactions with an intelligent virtual avatar.<sup>30</sup> Multiple similar interventions have emerged over the past decade leveraging the latest technological developments in multitouch and interactive interfaces,<sup>31-34</sup> humanoid-robot design,<sup>35</sup> virtual and augmented reality systems.<sup>36-38</sup>

Virtually all interactive technological developments rely on extensive libraries of labeled images of human emotion. Nonetheless, children are significantly underrepresented in these sources and thus the classifiers trained on these databases are not optimized for pediatric autism research.<sup>39</sup> Embracing the challenge, our team  recently developed a Charades-style mobile game [GuessWhat.stanford.edu](guesswhat.stanford.edu), which engages children with autism and their families in a fun and convenient interaction that reinforces prosocial learning while simultaneously generating data for diagnostic and therapeutic AI development.<sup>39, 40</sup> This is where you come in.

We need your help to develop the app’s capabilities! In an effort to corroborate and further increase GuessWhat?’s clinical efficacy, we are currently enrolling parents of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) to <b><span style="color:red"> participate in a fun research study!</span></b>
