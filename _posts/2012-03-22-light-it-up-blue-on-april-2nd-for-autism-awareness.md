International Autism Awareness Day takes place on April 2nd this year. People around the world will be illuminating buildings in blue and organizing other activities to generate awareness of autism and its impact on families and communities. Visit <a href="http://www.lightitupblue.org">LightItUpBlue.org</a> for suggestions on how you can be a part.

The Wall Lab focuses on understanding the complex genetics behind autism. Through our <a href="http://autworks.hms.harvard.edu">Autworks</a> initiative, we provide tools for researchers and informational resources for families who have a family member with autism.
