We are working on creative ways to “light it up blue” this month. We have decorated our lab and dressed top to bottom blue on April 2nd for World Autism Awareness Day. Up next is our blueberry cupcake party!

Aside from these community-building Autism Awareness lab events, we are proud of the progressive and productive year we have had here at the Wall Lab! We are making great gains in our research every day, and many of our successes are because of YOUR support. In the past year, we have published 10 papers, partnered with Boston Children’s Hospital in our research, reached close to 4,000 “likes” on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/autworks">Facebook</a> (thank you!), and received press highlighting our research gains (e.g., an article in <a href="http://healthland.time.com/2012/04/11/can-autism-really-be-diagnosed-in-minutes/">Time</a>).

We are currently testing and re-testing our methods for a faster and earlier path to Autism diagnosis. In the next year, we hope to finalize the work of detecting autism through home videos and brief questionnaires. All of this work will soon enable a mobilized tool that will help new families reach clinical care as early and as regularly as needed.  Check back soon for a link to the new video submission site, and for updates on our plans for bringing this tool to entire community in need of autism information and care.
