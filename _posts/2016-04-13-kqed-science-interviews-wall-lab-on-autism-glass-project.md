title: KQED Science interviews Wall Lab on Autism Glass Project 
---
The Autism Google Glass team and a participant in Phase II sat down with KQED journalist, Lindsey Hoshaw, to be featured in an [article published by KQED Science](http://ww2.kqed.org/futureofyou/2016/04/08/google-glass-flopped-but-kids-with-autism-are-using-it-to-learn-emotions/?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=socialmedia&utm_campaign=kqedmain), "Google Glass flopped. But kids with autism are using it to learn emotions." The article not only highlights work done by the glass team, but provides important attention to one of the projects participants, and how the device has helped her socialize with family and friends. The team is excited to get the word out about what google glass can do not only for participants in the study, but to more children with ASD who could benefit from the device.
