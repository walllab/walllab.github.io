title: Congratulations to Autism Google Glass team for Best Poster award
---
In early March, Autism Google Glass team members Nick Haber and Catalin Voss attended Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers' Winter conference on Applications of Computer Vision in Lake Placid, New York. While there, they presented a poster for their paper "A practical approach to real-time neutral feature subtraction for facial expression recognition" and won Best Poster Award. The paper focuses on improving social interactions for children with autism through the use of wearable glasses that give real-time social cues to the wearer. The device can record the type of and amount of eye contact recorded from the wearer, which can be a critical component of behavioral therapy. The study in which the glasses are used involves 100 participants from ages 6-16.
