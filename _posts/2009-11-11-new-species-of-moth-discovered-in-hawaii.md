My colleague, Dr. Dan Rubinoff, is the true Indiana Jones of biology. He just discovered a new species of moth on Hawaii check it out <a href = "http://www.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/20091104/BREAKING01/91104040/UH+researchers+find+new+moth+species+in+Papahanaumokuakea">here.</a>
PS: he also discovered a carnivorous moth. No kidding. Meat eating moths. Think about it.
