Amazing story by a brilliant evolutionary biologist at University of Hawaii. Truly cool stuff that everyone should now about. Listen <a href = "http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=125216857">here</a>. Or read the PNAS article <a href = "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20308549">here</a>.

By the way, this is the same modern day Indiana Jones of biology who discovered a flesh eating caterpillar, another novel find that further proves there's still much to discover about the diversity of life. If it's out there, Dr. Rubinoff is going to find it.
