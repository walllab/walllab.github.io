The Harvard Medical School and the University of Jaén have agreed to a partnership allowing international mobility of graduate students and research staff between the two institutions.

The agreement has emerged from the close cooperation developed between the Computational Biology Unit (Center for Biomedical Informatics) at Harvard Medical School, directed by Dennis P. Wall, and the Research Group Systems Biology of the University of Jaén, coordinated by Professor Francisco J. Esteban. 

For Victoria Lopez, this is a start "for future exchanges of degrees and other areas." Dennis P. Wall said the agreement stems from the collaboration of the two research groups, over the course of two years of joint investigations, which led development of computational methods,  "which help to detect the complex molecular alterations that occur in autism and its relationship to other autoimmune diseases, in order to identify new therapeutic targets."
