Peter Tonellato and I are co-directing and co-teaching with Peter Park and several others a new course on Next-Generation Sequencing Data and Implications. You can reach the course details, including lecture videos and slides, <a href = "http://lpm.hms.harvard.edu/palaver/">here </a>.

Recent developments in next-generation sequencing (NGS) have been tremendous and this NGS platforms play an increasingly prominent role in biological research. Infrastructure to manage the flow of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies experiments has been developed. NGS technologies enable the resequencing of entire - genomes or the sampling of entire transcriptomes more efficiently and economically and with greater depth than ever before. Identifying and tracking genetic variation is now so efficient and precise that thousands of variants can be tracked within large populations. Our capacity to produce such data for multiple cancers of the same type is improving, so this course will focus on the NGS data analysis method and the implication.
