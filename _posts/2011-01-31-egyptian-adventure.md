On December 18 and 19 Peter Tonellato and I delivered keynote talks and multiple training sessions in the areas of Cloud Computing (December 18) and Personalized Medicine (December 19) at Nile University. All of this was geared towards building new partnerships with our Egyptian colleagues at Nile University. We look forward to forging ahead, despite the recent conflicts that have erupted over the last month.
