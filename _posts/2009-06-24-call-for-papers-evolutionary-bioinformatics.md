As editor in chief of Evolutionary Bioinformatics, I recently blasted out a call for papers. The call is below, and also accessible <a href = "http://libertasacademica.blogspot.com/2009/06/call-for-papers-for-evolutionary.html"> here </a>.

The technological advances to high-throughput data generation have provided an unprecedented opportunity to unlock the evolutionary tempo and mode that has shaped the diversity of life. The need for innovative strategies that take advantage of this opportunity has never been greater. Our journal is fast becoming the premier venue for innovation of this kind â€“ strategies that leverage phylogeny to disentangle the origins of complexity at all levels, from sequence to biological systems.

Our popularity has grown due to exceptional research articles addressing this critical area of biology, but also due to a dedicated staff and committed editorial board that guarantee the speed of our publication process matches the speed of discovery. Your original research in evolutionary bioinformatics will reach the global community rapidly, effectively, and with unrestricted access.

I urge you to consider Evolutionary Bioinformatics in the future, and look forward to receiving your submissions.
