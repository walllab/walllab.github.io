In a recent study published in Molecular Autism the genes LRRN3 and LRRTM3, were significantly associated with susceptibility to ASD (read about it <a href="http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/183602.php" >here</a>.)

The good news for us is that we already knew about one of them, LRRN3, and have it linked up in the autworks system. Click <a href="https://rodeo.med.harvard.edu/graphViewer/graphViewer.html?g=Autism&s=LRRN3">here</a> to view it in the autism gene network.
