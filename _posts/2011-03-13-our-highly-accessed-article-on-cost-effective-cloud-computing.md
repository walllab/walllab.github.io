Our article on how to use the cloud for high performance computing has been accessed more than 1050 times since it's publication late in December 2010. You may view it here <a href = "http://www.la-press.com/cost-effective-cloud-computing-a-case-study-using-the-comparative-geno-article-a2422">here</a>.
Briefly, we created a model to estimate cloud runtime based on the size and complexity of the genomes being compared that determines in advance the optimal order of the jobs to be submitted. Using that, we computed orthologous relationships for 245,323 genome-to-genome comparisons on Amazonâ€™s computing cloud, a computation that required just over 200 hours and cost $8,000 USD, at least 40% less than expected under a strategy in which genome comparisons were submitted to the cloud randomly with respect to runtime. Our cost savings projections were based on a model that not only demonstrates the optimal strategy for deploying RSD to the cloud, but also finds the optimal cluster size to minimize waste and maximize usage. Our cost-reduction model is readily adaptable for other comparative genomics tools and potentially of significant benefit to labs seeking to take advantage of the cloud as an alternative to local computing infrastructure.
