Recently Dennis Wall and collaborators launched an exciting new effort aimed at annotating the vast amount of literature published on autism.

The effort is called <a href="http://bionotate.hms.harvard.edu/autism">BioNotate</a>. Bionotate represents an important step forward towards a sophisticated search engine that will enable faster, focused searches through the legacy of biomedical text on ASD, ultimately quickening the pace to discovery. The effort is a collaboration between Harvard University, University of Granada and Alias-i Inc.
