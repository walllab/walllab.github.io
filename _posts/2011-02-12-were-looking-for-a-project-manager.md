We have a job opening for a project manager to help orchestrate efforts associated with our autism research, in particular the <a href="http://autworks.hms.harvard.edu/">Autworks web portal</a>. Please <a href="http://wall.hms.harvard.edu/contact">contact us</a> if you are interested. Competitive salary, great working environment, and an opportunity to contribute to an important cause -- the search for the genetic causes of autism. Come on! Yeah!
