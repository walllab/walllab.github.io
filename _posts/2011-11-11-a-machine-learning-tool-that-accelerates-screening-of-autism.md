title: A Machine Learning Tool That Accelerates Screening of Autism

I recently gave a talk at the Autism Consortium Symposium held at Harvard Medical School on October 25 and attended by more than 600. In the talk I described my recent work on using artificial intelligence &amp; machine learning to abbreviate the best-of-breed tools used for behavioral recognition of autism spectrum disorders.  These approaches have helped me to identify a substantially shorter instrument that takes only minutes to complete but that achieves the same accuracy as the gold-standard tools. The Simons Foundation ran an article about the talk and the tools, that you can read <a href="http://sfari.org/news-and-opinion/conference-news/2011/machine-learning-tool-offers-rapid-accurate-autism-diagnosis">here </a>.
