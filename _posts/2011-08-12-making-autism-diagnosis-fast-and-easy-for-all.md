We have improved our <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/SW839YJ">short questionnaire</a> for screening and diagnosis of autism, and through the help of over 2000 participants have measured it to be over 98% accurate. The questionnaire contains only 7 questions and takes minutes to complete, 93% shorter than the standard tool and over 2 hours faster. If you are a careprovider for someone with autism, you can contribute to our research by answering the questions in this questionnaire  <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/SW839YJ">here</a>.
