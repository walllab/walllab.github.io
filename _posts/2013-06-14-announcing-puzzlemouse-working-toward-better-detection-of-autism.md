The Wall Lab has launched a new website that will advance our research into use of home videos and web technology for autism detection, and bring it a step closer to clinical applicability.

<a href="http://puzzlemouse.hms.harvard.edu">PuzzleMouse</a> provides a way for parents to participate in this research by uploading short videos of their children who have been tested for an Autism Spectrum Disorder. We are seeking participation from caregivers of children 7 years and younger.

The site also collects answers to a short number of behavioral questions. We run our behavioral assessment algorithms on all of the collected data to generate a score that is associated with confidence in an autism diagnosis. With the videos and surveys collected here, we will be able to move this technology from the testing phase into actual clinical use so that it can be of value to both families and clinicians in everyday care.
