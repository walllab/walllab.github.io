title: It's Autism Awareness Month!
---

It’s that time of year to bring awareness to our community about autism, and what better way to do it than by attending Stanford’s events or participating in our studies! Here are some things you can do to bring awareness to your community:

[2017 Dance-a-thon for Autism to benefit several autism-serving nonprofits, April 15](http://www.danceathonforautism17.myevent.com/participant/531317) <br />
Join the “Bay Area Kind” team or make a donation to benefit autism-serving nonprofits in the bay area!

[2017 Autism at Work Summit, April 12-14](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/autism-at-work-summit-reception-panel-discussion-and-exhibit-registration-31694680643) <br />
Attend this conference at Stanford University to learn about careers for individuals with autism!

### Our Studies:

[Spread the word about GapMap!](https://gapmap.stanford.edu/) <br />
We just launched our GapMap website and are looking for families affected by autism to add themselves to the map. Check it out and spread the word to help us gain a better understanding on the prevalence of autism and availability of resources!

[Help us finish our Autism Glass RCT!](https://autismglassrecruitment.stanford.edu/) <br />
We are only 14 families away from completing our Autism Glass Study, so if you know any children ages 6-12 who may be interested in taking home a pair of autism glass for 6 weeks, send them over to our [online screening questionnaire!](https://autismglassrecruitment.stanford.edu/)
