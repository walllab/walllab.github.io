I was recently invited to join the <a href = "http://www.f1000biology.com/about/biography/1696185935244561">Faculty of 1000</a>, Biology -- the next generation literature awareness tool. It is a revolutionary online research service that comprehensively and systematically highlights and reviews the most interesting papers published in the biological sciences, based on the recommendations of a faculty of well over 2300 selected leading researchers ("Faculty Members").
