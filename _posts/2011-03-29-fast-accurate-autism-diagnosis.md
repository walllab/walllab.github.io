title: Fast Accurate Autism Diagnosis

We recently designed a short, but effective behavioral questionnaire to diagnose autism.  We have wrapped that questionnaire into an online <a href="http://autworks.hms.harvard.edu/community/survey"> survey</a> in hopes that the entire community of caregivers will help us to validate the accuracy. So far, over 250 people have participated! We hope to bring that number to 500 by the end of the week -- April 1, 2011.  Please help us spread the word.

More information:

Autism can be diagnosed through the use of a behavioral exam named the "Autism Diagnostic Interview – Revised" or ADI-R (Western Psychological Services). However, because this survey is long – it has 93 questions and can take up to 2.5 hours to complete – the diagnosis process can be prohibitive. We have designed a substantially shorter exam of 7 questions that we believe may be as effective as the ADI-R at diagnosing autistic children. Should this prove to be true, our exam would help healthcare providers diagnose autistic children more rapidly and enable children to receive valuable therapy that is more in tune with the timing of their development and more likely to have a positive outcome. One big way to determine if our abbreviated exam is effective is to get your help.

If you are a care provider for a person with autism, your answers to the few questions in the following survey will tell us whether our exam actually works. Please click <a href="http://autworks.hms.harvard.edu/community/survey">here</a> to load the survey and get started. It will take no more than 10 minutes of your time.
