We just published a paper entitled "cloud computing for comparative genomics" accessible <a href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/11/259/abstract">here</a> that has become the most highly accessed paper in BMC Bioinformatics in less than a months time.  It details our recent efforts with Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud and Elastic MapReduce web service. Expect the cloud to become a premier computing solution for translational bioinformatics.
