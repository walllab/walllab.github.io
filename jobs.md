### Lead Mobile Engineer (Machine Learning / Computer Vision Focus)

The laboratory of Dennis Wall at Stanford School of Medicine is looking for a driven mobile engineer to head up mobile application development in our technology team on the <a href="http://wall-lab.stanford.edu/projects/autism-therapy-on-glass/">Autism Glass Project.</a> 

#### Primary Purpose

You should have a strong background in computer science, systems, and mobile application development. You don’t rely on a UI design contractor to get you a PSD of what the app is supposed to look like. You love user interfaces and user experience design. You can design good architectures where it’s necessary, but you’re enough of a hacker to get the job done. Ideally, you’ve also developed some low-level software tools and understand what it means to do heavy computation in C++ on a low-powered mobile device. Finally, you’re tremendously excited about building an application that helps kids with Autism recognize social cues.

Ideal candidates for this position have built several Android applications and at least one iOS app, are familiar with low-level tools like the NDK.

#### Required Experience:

*	Mobile development experience on iOS and Android in Objective-C, Java, and using the Android NDK
*	Excited to develop on new platforms
*	Understanding of networking protocols
*	Track record of shipping and scaling products in a non-research setting
*	Excellent engineering communication skills
*	Comfortable in a Unix environment with common developer tools

#### Desired:

*	GPU Programming experience
*	At least one scripting language and a basic understanding of processing large datasets
*	Basic knowledge of image processing, machine learning, and computer vision and familiarity with OpenCV

To apply, please contact nhaber AT stanford DOT edu

* knowledge mining technologies such as Weka, and
* the use of high-performance computing (HPC) management software such as Sun Grid Engine (SGE), PVM, or MPI or cloud-based computing (e.g. Amazon, or others), is required. 


Additionally, the employee is required to have experience in a number of bioinformatics domains including,

* genomic sequence analysis,
* gene expression analysis,
* comparative genomics and phylogenetics, and
* analysis of genetic variation within organisms and across populations. 

Strong experience in data mining and statistics is a must.  The candidate must have a high level of integrity and excellent judgment concerning privacy issues. Prior experience in writing and publishing scientific manuscripts is a must.  Prior background in autism genetics or similar complex genetic disease is a plus. Strong written and oral communication skills in English are essential.
