#Openings in the Wall Lab
<hr>

Our lab is interested in the design and application of translational bioinformatics tools to help bring whole-genomic data to the point of clinical care. We're developing new techniques to be rapidly transformed into clinically actionable reports that yield prognostic predictions, drive decision support for alternative lines of therapy, and other medically actionable outcomes for autism.

If that sounds interesting to you, We're looking for individuals with a passion for computational biology.
